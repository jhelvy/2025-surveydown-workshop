### 1. Install R & Quarto

You need both: 
 
- Install [{{< fa brands r-project >}}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/)
- Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for R, Quarto, and Shiny.

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is great, and we also like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron).

### 2. Install the `surveydown` and `sdApps` R packages

We recommend installing the development versions of `surveydown` and `sdApps` from GitHub:

```{r}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak(c("surveydown-dev/surveydown", "surveydown-dev/sdApps"))
```
